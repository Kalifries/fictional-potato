# === ANDROID WORKBENCH ===

##TL;DR
- I've been learning to code recently and am a complete noob, but I have worked on Linux machines my entire life as well as mess around with just about anything that has to do with tech. including my newest fascination with Android phones and their hidden capabilities.  I figured I would put both of my small projects together and combine them into something that maybe others would enjoy or maybe one day even possibly use.  The idea is to take a bunch of commands from adb and fastboot and to automate them and make them a little more user friendly to the people who don't enjoy living in a terminal.  I am coming up with all of this off the top of my head and would apreciate any feedback or ideas that the community may have to offer, maybe even some of the help because as I have said I am very new to coding and I'm and infant to Python.  Just trying to have some fun with this and I really hope others might do the same.  Feel free to get ahold of me anytime and ask any questions you might have or point out how many times this has probably been done before.  Even so, I think I might just have something I can bring to the table.
